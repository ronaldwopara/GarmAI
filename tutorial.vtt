00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Young Little Newbird doesn't know anything about game development, but wants to make

00:04.200 --> 00:06.280
his favorite games on the Roblox platform.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.320
He reads up on the Roblox documentation to learn how to make a game until he hits a

00:10.320 --> 00:15.040
Roblox trying to figure out what the heck a script is and how a game comes together.

00:15.040 --> 00:19.640
And as a result of that, he quits on day one, and probably doesn't have a computer

00:19.640 --> 00:25.000
anymore after destroying it out of frustration, and now he can't pursue making the games

00:25.000 --> 00:26.400
he's always wanted to make.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.720
Oh, Newbird, becoming a Roblox game developer doesn't happen overnight.

00:29.720 --> 00:33.680
You'll especially have to put in the time, put in the effort, and face the struggles

00:33.680 --> 00:39.120
head on when you don't understand a concept, especially in the world of scripting and programming.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.840
In the beginning, it can be very difficult and demotivating to continuously learn how

00:42.840 --> 00:47.000
to become a better Roblox scriptor when you keep getting faced with error messages and

00:47.000 --> 00:48.400
unintended effects in your game.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.480
It's a real struggle most beginners face when learning how to script on Roblox, which

00:52.480 --> 00:56.840
is why I want to make this playlist to help you reach your goals of making the games

00:56.840 --> 00:58.840
that you want to create on Roblox.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.600
My name is Braudev, and I will be teaching you everything you need to know to become

01:02.600 --> 01:03.920
a great Roblox scriptor.

01:03.920 --> 01:08.000
I've been scripting on Roblox for about 7 to 8 years, and during this time, I've made

01:08.000 --> 01:10.720
countless projects that just weren't successful.

01:10.720 --> 01:15.080
But one thing that kept me going throughout all these years was the desire to learn more

01:15.080 --> 01:18.200
and actually have an interest in the things I was learning.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.120
Even if I face challenges when learning new things, especially during times when I was

01:22.120 --> 01:26.640
demotivated, and I hope you can adopt the secret strategy to go through this journey

01:26.640 --> 01:28.760
of becoming a Roblox game developer.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.520
As of recording this video, I have two playlists ready for you to watch once you finish

01:32.520 --> 01:37.000
this beginner's guide, the advanced scripting tutorial guide, and the GUI tutorial guide.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.600
It's quite a scary journey to go through all these episodes, considering how many there

01:40.600 --> 01:45.400
are now, but like I mentioned, becoming a Roblox game developer isn't easy.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.880
And so I would like to make the journey easier for you by having everything you need to

01:48.880 --> 01:54.880
know in these playlists, ranging from the very basics to the advanced concepts and accelerate

01:54.880 --> 01:59.760
you to become a pro Roblox scriptor and game developer in 2024.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.920
And with that being said, let's now go ahead and start making games on Roblox.

02:03.920 --> 02:09.040
Alright, so what you see here is the homepage of the software called Roblox Studio.

02:09.040 --> 02:13.600
Now this is the software we're going to be using to create our Roblox games so that we

02:13.600 --> 02:18.480
can upload them to the Roblox website and so players can actually play your game that's

02:18.480 --> 02:19.480
uploaded to Roblox.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.600
I'll leave a link to this in the description if you want to download Roblox Studio so that

02:23.600 --> 02:27.720
you can log in with your account and then you can be greeted with this same exact home

02:27.720 --> 02:29.740
screen just like you're seeing in this video.

02:29.740 --> 02:35.520
Now before we do anything, I encourage you to basically follow exactly what I do step

02:35.520 --> 02:40.760
by step so that you can kind of get a feel for how to use Roblox Studio and you're experiencing

02:40.760 --> 02:44.840
what I'm teaching you while you follow through with these videos because just watching

02:44.840 --> 02:48.820
me go through these tutorial videos isn't going to be enough to help you learn.

02:48.820 --> 02:53.480
So that's why I encourage you to literally do exactly what I do as you watch these videos

02:53.480 --> 02:57.240
to follow along and learn from doing it yourself as well.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.600
So now that we've gotten that out of the way, once we are here inside his home screen,

03:01.600 --> 03:06.040
Roblox has a bunch of templates that we can choose from as a starter place to start making

03:06.040 --> 03:07.240
our Roblox games.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.840
For the purpose of this tutorial guide, we're going to use this base play template right

03:10.840 --> 03:11.840
here.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.360
I'm just going to click on this and then what's going to happen is Roblox is going to load

03:14.360 --> 03:19.800
in this template that we just selected and now we are thrown into this world that we

03:19.800 --> 03:24.000
can now mess around with to create our Roblox game and upload it onto the platform.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.560
Now there are a couple of things here that I want to introduce to you so that you get

03:27.560 --> 03:31.720
a feel for how Roblox Studio works because that's our goal for this first episode.

03:31.720 --> 03:35.880
It's to familiarize ourselves with using Roblox Studio and some of the things that they have

03:35.880 --> 03:36.880
to offer.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.520
One thing I want to show you is being able to navigate around this 3D world that you

03:40.520 --> 03:43.360
see right here that represents our Roblox game.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.200
So I want you to imagine you're playing Roblox on PC.

03:46.200 --> 03:51.440
The controls you probably use are W, AS, and D for the keys and also the mouse as well.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.440
So it kind of works the same way here as well.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.000
So if we hold W that's going to move our camera forward, if we hold S that's going to move

03:58.000 --> 04:01.480
our camera backwards, if we hold A that's going to go left and then D that's going to

04:01.480 --> 04:02.480
go right.

04:02.520 --> 04:07.040
If we want to move the camera specifically, then what we can do is hold the right mouse

04:07.040 --> 04:11.960
button and then drag our mouse around the world so that we can change our camera to

04:11.960 --> 04:15.760
face a certain direction and we can combine these movements together so that we're able

04:15.760 --> 04:18.760
to move around studio as we so desire to.

04:18.760 --> 04:23.760
Some other things we can do is hold Q to make our camera go down and then hold E to make

04:23.760 --> 04:28.520
your camera go up and we can even use the scrolling wheel to scroll outward and also

04:28.520 --> 04:30.080
scroll inward as well.

04:30.080 --> 04:35.240
So these are some basic movement controls that I will introduce to you for this episode

04:35.240 --> 04:39.040
and maybe go through some more later down the line, but that's like the basics of being

04:39.040 --> 04:41.920
able to move around inside of Roblox Studio.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.400
So now there are some some windows that I want to show you that are going to be very

04:45.400 --> 04:47.540
important for the entirety of this tutorial guide.

04:47.540 --> 04:54.080
The first one is this Roblox Studio ribbon up here that basically shows all of the resources

04:54.080 --> 05:00.480
and services that they have provided to us so that we can use them for our Roblox game.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.360
So right now we're in the home category.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.880
So if we select a different tab like model, then it's going to show us a bunch of different

05:05.880 --> 05:07.480
things here that we can use.

05:07.480 --> 05:12.520
And if we go to avatar, it's going to show some different stuff, test, view, plugins,

05:12.520 --> 05:15.360
and all of these other sorts of things that are going to be very helpful for us.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.160
Now another window that's extremely important to understand is what's called the Explorer

05:20.160 --> 05:22.080
as you can see right here on the right side.

05:22.080 --> 05:26.120
You can see that there's all of these different folders inside of here with different names.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.920
And I'm going to try and give a brief explanation as to what this all means.

05:29.920 --> 05:35.560
Well, to basically summarize what the Explorer is, it's basically a directory full of folders

05:35.560 --> 05:40.480
that have its own specific purposes where you combine all of them together to make up one

05:40.480 --> 05:41.720
Roblox game.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.960
So every single Roblox game you can think of basically has this structure right here with

05:45.960 --> 05:49.880
all of these different folders with different purposes that you will need to learn how

05:49.880 --> 05:51.960
to use as a Roblox game developer.

05:51.960 --> 05:57.360
So one of the ones as an example is called workspace workspace is what basically shows

05:57.360 --> 05:59.840
us the entire 3D world.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.720
And this is how we're able to render things inside of this game screen.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.480
It's when we put objects inside of this workspace folder.

06:06.480 --> 06:11.160
Now if we were to open up this workspace folder, so if we click on this arrow that's to the

06:11.160 --> 06:16.040
left of it, then we can see that there's actually stuff contained within this workspace folder.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.360
So we have the camera, terrain, spawn location, base play and things like that.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.200
And if we open these up, we can see that there is other stuff in here contained within

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
the thing that's within the workspace.

06:25.200 --> 06:30.360
So you can kind of see that there's this hierarchy structure going on with this workspace.

06:30.360 --> 06:34.520
And it's very important to understand the structure when you're working with finding

06:34.520 --> 06:35.920
stuff within your game.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.880
And so it's a really good practice to understand how this structure works.

06:39.880 --> 06:44.600
Now if I were to select one of these objects, like let's say the workspace, we can see

06:44.680 --> 06:50.720
that down here, it showed a bunch of things in this other window called properties.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.440
Now this is the next window that is going to be extremely important to understand.

06:55.440 --> 07:00.200
So basically what this window does is it shows all of the properties, the attributes, the

07:00.200 --> 07:06.080
settings or configurations, whatever you want to describe it as for the object that we selected.

07:06.080 --> 07:11.000
So what we selected is this workspace object and there's all these properties here that

07:11.000 --> 07:15.200
are associated with that object that we can actually change ourselves.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.160
And if we select a different objects, like let's say the spawn location, it's going

07:18.160 --> 07:22.800
to show different properties for this spawn location object.

07:22.800 --> 07:28.480
And we can actually change it and see the change in real time inside of our game.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.680
So if we were to let's say change the color, let's say, so if I click on the color, then

07:32.680 --> 07:36.200
it's going to show us this color wheel right here that we can just pick whichever color

07:36.200 --> 07:37.200
we want.

07:37.200 --> 07:42.160
So let's say pick this color and I hit OK, then it's going to change the color in real

07:42.160 --> 07:45.360
time and we can actually see this change inside of Roblox Studio.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.520
So that's kind of a cool thing to know about when it comes to understanding the properties

07:49.520 --> 07:55.040
window and also the Explorer window and how both of them work together to basically have

07:55.040 --> 07:57.600
stuff inside of our workspace.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.200
And now the next thing I want to demonstrate is being able to add parts inside of the game.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.200
So I'm actually going to deselect the spawn location by simply selecting anywhere inside

08:05.200 --> 08:07.280
of this world, just like that.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.640
And what I'm going to do is go on the top ribbon and click on this part button that's

08:11.640 --> 08:13.920
inside of the insert category.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.440
So I'm going to click this.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.560
And as you can see Roblox has inserted a part for us to use and what I can do is take this

08:20.560 --> 08:25.560
part, hold left click and drag it wherever I want to put it inside of the workspace.

08:25.560 --> 08:30.000
Now there are other tools that I want to introduce to you that you might find extremely helpful.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.560
So we're able to select this and move it around.

08:32.560 --> 08:37.360
This is what's called the select tool as you can see up here on the screen.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.160
The next tool is called move.

08:39.160 --> 08:44.560
So if we select this, then we can see these arrows that are surrounding this part.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.920
So if we hold this blue arrow and then move it this way, then it's going to move the

08:48.920 --> 08:53.120
part in this specific direction and we can do the same thing for the red arrow and we

08:53.120 --> 08:55.560
can do the same thing for the green arrow as well.

08:55.560 --> 09:00.760
Another thing we can do is change the size of this part by clicking on this scale tool.

09:00.760 --> 09:05.840
So if we scale this part this way, then it's going to move it in this direction.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.080
And the last tool is the rotate tool.

09:08.080 --> 09:12.880
So if we select this, then we can see that this basically resembles a bunch of circles.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.120
We select whichever circle we want and then we move it in that direction specifically.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.200
So I'm kind of just moving this part around a little bit.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.160
And that is basically how you use the rotate part.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.880
Now once again, I want to deselect this.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.440
So I'm just going to click elsewhere like this.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.360
And now we have a part that basically just does absolutely nothing.

09:29.360 --> 09:35.480
But what I wanted to get at here was getting the feel and practice for moving around Roblox

09:35.480 --> 09:38.600
Studio and also adding parts into the game.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.120
So that's basically the introduction to using Roblox Studio.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.520
Now at the end of every single video for this playlist, what I want to do is give you a

09:46.520 --> 09:52.800
learning objective or a challenge to assess what you learned inside of each video.

09:52.800 --> 09:58.000
Now for this learning objective, what I want you to do is basically just continue to experiment

09:58.000 --> 10:02.560
with Roblox Studio either by moving around inside of the workspace or by adding more

10:02.560 --> 10:03.680
parts like this.

10:03.680 --> 10:08.280
So I'm actually going to go up here and I'm going to insert another part.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.600
And we can do whatever we want with it by changing the brick color, changing the size

10:12.600 --> 10:14.880
if we select the scale tool just like this.

10:14.880 --> 10:19.040
And you know, things like that, you can even navigate through more settings over here.

10:19.040 --> 10:23.120
And that's another great way of familiarizing yourself with Roblox Studio.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.640
And once you are done with this learning objective, I want you to go down to the comments of

10:26.640 --> 10:31.360
this video and describe what you did for this learning objective so that other people

10:31.360 --> 10:35.000
who watch this tutorial can see what other people have been doing.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.920
And I think it would just be a really great way to show what everybody else is doing for

10:38.920 --> 10:40.240
these challenges.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.200
Now before we end off this video, there's one final thing I forgot to mention and that

10:44.200 --> 10:48.080
is the importance of saving your work so that you don't lose your progress.

10:48.080 --> 10:53.200
So what we can do is go on the top left here in file and we're going to click Save to

10:53.200 --> 10:57.680
file as and it's going to show up our file directory right here.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.440
And you can just pick wherever you want to save this Roblox Studio place in.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.080
So I'm just going to pick this place.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.920
You can even rename it to whatever you want to.

11:04.920 --> 11:11.000
I'm just going to say beginner scripting guide to the 2024 just like that.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.720
And I'm going to hit enter and there we go.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.440
Now our place is saved.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.480
And I encourage you to save your game very frequently so that you don't lose progress

11:18.480 --> 11:20.360
as you go through this tutorial guide.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.760
So that's pretty much going to be it for this episode and I will see you in the next

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
episode.

11:24.760 --> 11:25.440
Take care.
