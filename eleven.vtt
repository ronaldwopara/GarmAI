00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
It's late, and the air in this place is always dry and cold.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.880
On every desk, someone's hoping for a breakthrough.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.480
Most won't find it, but they keep showing up anyway.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.120
One man's been doing that for 15 years,

00:15.120 --> 00:18.640
trying to make a drug that could save millions of lives.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.880
And he's lost a lot along the way.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.840
Birthdays, full dinner tables.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.800
Mornings where someone should have still been there.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.440
He doesn't talk about it.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.960
He just shows up.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.200
But part of him still hopes.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.240
Slower, heartfelt, still waiting for the day

00:35.240 --> 00:36.960
when all of it will matter.
